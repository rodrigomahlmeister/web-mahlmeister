In this article we present recent evidence about intergenerational mobility in Brazil. We verified that the degree of educational persistence has decreased substantially since the 1990s, for all regions, races and household situations. This is explained by the increase in educational attainment of the children of the schooled parents and by the stabilization of educational attainment of the children of more schooled parents around 11 years of schooling. Despite this, mobility is still lower for the children of less schooled parents. Finally, we report an increase in educational mobility among younger generations.
