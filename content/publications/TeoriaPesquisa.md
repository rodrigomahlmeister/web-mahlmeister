This article examines the idea that “policies make politics”. I seek to place this  idea  in  the  ongoing  theoretical  debate  and demonstrate  how  it  rejects behaviorist premises, as well as Harold Lasswell and David Easton’s classical model. The policy feedback argument and its ramifications substantiate reference literature on  policy  analysis,  which makes  it  the  founding  argument  inthe  field  of  historical institutionalism. I show that the mechanism initially takes shape from the standpoint of state bureaucracy, as it affects the state’s administrative capacities, learning, and articulation with non-state actors. Paul Pierson then increases its scope, showing that the  role  policies  play  as  resources,  incentives,  and  sources  of  information  is  not restricted  to  government  elites  and  interest  groups,  but  may  also  apply  to  the electorate’s  behavior  more  broadly.  This  discussion  outlines  key  policy  analysis concepts, highlights the internal nuances of the field, and sheds light on how theories and their analytical gains have developed historically.
