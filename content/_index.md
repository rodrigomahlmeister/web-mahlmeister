Welcome! I hold a Bachelor's degree in Economics and a Master's degree in Political Science from the [University of Sao Paulo](https://www5.usp.br/), in Brazil.

I work as Research Assistant for Natalia Bueno ([Emory University](http://polisci.emory.edu/home/)) and as a researcher at the [Center for Metropolitan Studies](https://centrodametropole.fflch.usp.br/en) (CEM/Cebrap).

My interest lies at the intersection of comparative politics and the political economy of inequality, with a focus on Latin America.

My [Master's thesis](https://t.co/8K15s8QISA) on preferences for redistribution was recently awarded the national prize for the best dissertation in all social sciences by the National Graduate Studies Association in Social Sciences ([ANPOCS](https://www.anpocs.com/)).
